Description: rwnnet implements randomized feed-forward neural network where the
        hidden layers are random initialized and fixed during training. The
        network is fitted in a single-pass by training a regularized least 
        squares read-out layer - Tikhonov regularization through an efficient
        SVD-based algorithm. As an additional regularization mechanism gaussian
        noise is added both to the inputs and output(s) of the network.
        The key components of are written in C++, using Rcpp, and binded to R
        for maximum performance and ease-of-use. Shallow and deep network can
        be trained using the Extreme Learning Machine and the Random Vector
        Functional Link frameworks.  Supports regression, multi-output 
        regression and classification. Depending on the algorithm chosen it
        allows to fit an implicit ensemble model.
